    "summary": "Claims of 'cancel culture' are frequently used by Musk and his supporters to portray criticism, media scrutiny, or platform moderation as illegitimate attempts to silence him, legitimizing his free-speech rhetoric and policy changes at Twitter/X and resisting calls for accountability. Critics counter that invoking cancel culture lets him deflect responsibility, oppose content moderation, and protect controversial speech or business decisions from consequences.",

    "summary": "Rogan’s high-profile, informal interviews with Musk are frequently used by supporters to humanize him, amplify his contrarian free‑speech and techno‑visionary persona, and justify admiration for his ideas and leadership style. Critics counter that Rogan’s sympathetic platforming helps normalize and shield Musk from scrutiny—downplaying regulatory, labor, and misinformation concerns while contributing to uncritical celebrity worship of a powerful billionaire.",

Critics counter that UAW campaigns against Musk depict unions as protectionist obstacles to innovation, reinforcing a polarized debate over regulation vs. market-driven disruption.",

Supporters of Musk, by contrast, typically dismiss O’Brien’s critiques as ideological resistance to innovation and private‑sector management, using his stance to frame pro‑Musk arguments about competitiveness and entrepreneurship.",

When he disappoints them, QAnon can pivot to portray him as part of the global elite, using that framing to either lionize or delegitimize his actions within broader ‘deep state’ rhetoric.",

If Musk disappoints its audience, the site pivots to criticize him as compromised or promote fringe theories that tie him to elite or conspiratorial interests.",

Critics flip the trope to argue Musk either collaborates with or empowers shadowy power networks via government contracts and surveillance technologies, using it to demand stricter accountability and limits on his influence.",
