    "wiki_title": "fiat money",
    "summary": "In debates about Ulysses S. Grant, references to fiat money center on his handling of post‑Civil War currency — opponents blame his hard‑money turn and limits on unbacked greenbacks for deflation and hardship for debtors after the Panic of 1873, while defenders argue his push toward specie convertibility restored fiscal credibility and international confidence; thus ‘fiat money’ is used to frame Grant as either fiscally responsible or insensitive to working‑class economic pain.",
