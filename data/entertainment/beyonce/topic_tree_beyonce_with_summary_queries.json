Discussions also invoke counterfeit cosmetics and clothing tied to her likeness as safety and authenticity concerns, prompting calls for stronger marketplace accountability while opponents frame enforcement as privileging corporate interests over fan access.",

Critics and some originating artists counter that certain borrowings lack sufficient transformation and therefore support stricter attribution, licensing, or compensation rather than allowing her reuse unchallenged.",
